Various\nrelaxations of these bounds allow to recover well known bounds such as\n(strengthenings of) Cramer-Rao's and Pinsker's inequalities. In particular we\nobtain a master inequality, named Symmetric Response Intensity Relation, which\nrecovers several TURs as particular cases. We employ this set of bounds for\nthree physical applications. First, we derive a trade-off between thermodynamic\ncost (dissipated free energy) and reliability of systems switching instantly\nbetween two states, such as one-bit memories. We derive in particular a lower\nbound of $2.8 k_BT$ per Shannon bit to write a bit in such a memory, a bound\ndistinct from Landauer's one. Second, we obtain a new family of classic speed\nlimits which provide lower bounds for non-autonomous Markov processes on the\ntime needed to transition between two probabilistic states in terms of a\nthermodynamic quantity (e.g. non-equilibrium free energy) and a kinetic\nquantity (e.g. dynamical activity).

The formal uncertainties are factors of 1.6 and 2.0,\nrespectively. With the exception of the lower limit on the X-ray size, the\nresults are very stable against any changes in the priors used in the analysis.\nBased on the Hbeta line-width, we estimate that the black hole mass is ~10^8\nMsun, which corresponds to a gravitational radius of r_g~2 10^13 cm. Thus, the\nX-ray emission is emerging on scales of ~10r_g and the 400 nm emission on\nscales of ~70 r_g. A standard thin disk of this size should be significantly\nbrighter than observed.

Another key component of our method is the prediction of facial\nlandmarks reflecting speaker-aware dynamics. Based on this intermediate\nrepresentation, our method is able to synthesize photorealistic videos of\nentire talking heads with full range of motion and also animate artistic\npaintings, sketches, 2D cartoon characters, Japanese mangas, stylized\ncaricatures in a single unified framework. We present extensive quantitative\nand qualitative evaluation of our method, in addition to user studies,\ndemonstrating generated talking heads of significantly higher quality compared\nto prior state-of-the-art.\n"}

We developed the general\npotential to account for the possibility of WP due to contaminants (both\nforeign and local to the material) consequently shifting the eqiulibrium points\nof the MD the material. For instance, dynamics of Au and Fe were studied with O\nbombardments/contamination (oxygenated environments), and those of CSiGe were\nstudied with W, Ti, and O. It was found that the phase-shift, of the\neqiulibrium points of the MD simulations, for Au stabilised for just five atoms\nof oxygen while that of Fe did not, when interacting in separate oxygenated\nenvironments.

Techniques to construct detectors that are portable and fast on low\npowered devices are also addressed by exploring new lightweight convolutional\nbase architectures. Ultimately, a rigorous review of the strengths and\nweaknesses of each detector leads us to the present state of the art.\n"}

{"text": "Time Localization and Capacity of Faster-Than-Nyquist Signaling   In this paper, we consider communication over the bandwidth limited analog\nwhite Gaussian noise channel using non-orthogonal pulses. In particular, we\nconsider non-orthogonal transmission by signaling samples at a rate higher than\nthe Nyquist rate. Using the faster-than-Nyquist (FTN) framework, Mazo showed\nthat one may transmit symbols carried by sinc pulses at a higher rate than that\ndictated by Nyquist without loosing bit error rate. However, as we will show in\nthis paper, such pulses are not necessarily well localized in time. In fact,\nassuming that signals in the FTN framework are well localized in time, one can\nconstruct a signaling scheme that violates the Shannon capacity bound. We also\nshow directly that FTN signals are in general not well localized in time.\nTherefore, the results of Mazo do not imply that one can transmit more data per\ntime unit without degrading performance in terms of error probability.\n  We also consider FTN signaling in the case of pulses that are different from\nthe sinc pulses. We show that one can use a precoding scheme of low complexity\nto remove the inter-symbol interference. This leads to the possibility of\nincreasing the number of transmitted samples per time unit and compensate for\nspectral inefficiency due to signaling at the Nyquist rate of the non sinc\npulses. We demonstrate the power of the precoding scheme by simulations.\n"}

{"text": "Microwave-to-optical frequency conversion using a cesium atom coupled to\n  a superconducting resonator   A candidate for converting quantum information from microwave to optical\nfrequencies is the use of a single atom that interacts with a superconducting\nmicrowave resonator on one hand and an optical cavity on the other. The large\nelectric dipole moments and microwave transition frequencies possessed by\nRydberg states allow them to couple strongly to superconducting devices. Lasers\ncan then be used to connect a Rydberg transition to an optical transition to\nrealize the conversion. Since the fundamental source of noise in this process\nis spontaneous emission from the atomic levels, the resulting control problem\ninvolves choosing the pulse shapes of the driving lasers so as to maximize the\ntransfer rate while minimizing this loss. Here we consider the concrete example\nof a cesium atom, along with two specific choices for the levels to be used in\nthe conversion cycle.

{"text": "T-RACKs: A Faster Recovery Mechanism for TCP in Data Center Networks   Cloud interactive data-driven applications generate swarms of small TCP flows\nthat compete for the small buffer space in data-center switches. Such\napplications require a short flow completion time (FCT) to perform their jobs\neffectively. However, TCP is oblivious to the composite nature of application\ndata and artificially inflates the FCT of such flows by several orders of\nmagnitude. This is due to TCP's Internet-centric design that fixes the\nretransmission timeout (RTO) to be at least hundreds of milliseconds. To better\nunderstand this problem, in this paper, we use empirical measurements in a\nsmall testbed to study, at a microscopic level, the effects of various types of\npacket losses on TCP's performance. In particular, we single out packet losses\nthat impact the tail end of small flows, as well as bursty losses, that span a\nsignificant fraction of the small congestion window of TCP flows in\ndata-centers, to show a non-negligible effect on the FCT. Based on this, we\npropose the so-called, timely-retransmitted ACKs (or T-RACKs), a simple loss\nrecovery mechanism to conceal the drawbacks of the long RTO even in the\npresence of heavy packet losses. Interestingly enough, T-RACKS achieves this\ntransparently to TCP itself as it does not require any change to TCP in the\ntenant's virtual machine (VM). T-RACKs can be implemented as a software shim\nlayer in the hypervisor between the VMs and server's NIC or in hardware as a\nnetworking function in a SmartNIC.

{"text": "The Massive Star Clusters in the Dwarf Merger ESO 185-IG13: is the Red\n  Excess Ubiquitous in Starbursts?   We have investigated the starburst properties of the luminous blue compact\ngalaxy ESO 185-IG13. The galaxy has been imaged with the high resolution\ncameras onboard to the Hubble Space Telescope. From the UV to the IR, the data\nreveal a system shaped by hundreds of young star clusters, and fine structures,\nlike a tidal stream and a shell. The presence of numerous clusters and the\nperturbed morphology indicate that the galaxy has been involved in a recent\nmerger event. Using previous simulations of shell formation in galaxy mergers\nwe constrain potential progenitors of ESO 185-IG13. The analysis of the star\ncluster population is used to investigate the properties of the present\nstarburst and to date the final merger event, which has produced hundreds of\nclusters younger than 100 Myr. We have found a peak of cluster formation only\n3.5 Myr old. A large fraction of these clusters will not survive after 10-20\nMyr, due to the \"infant mortality\" caused by gas expulsion. However, this\nsample of clusters represents an unique chance to investigate the youngest\nphases of cluster evolution. As already observed in the analog blue compact\ngalaxy Haro 11, a fraction of young clusters are affected by a flux excess at\nwavelengths longer than 8000 \\AA. Ages, masses, and extinctions of clusters\nwith this NIR excess are estimated from UV and optical data. We discuss\nsimilarities and differences of the observed NIR excess in ESO 185-IG13\nclusters with other cases in the literature. The cluster ages and masses are\nused to distinguish among the potential causes of the excess. We observe, as in\nHaro 11, that the use of the IR and the (commonly used) I band data results in\noverestimates of age and mass in clusters affected by the NIR excess.

{"text": "Interaction-driven topological insulator states in strained graphene   The electronic properties of graphene can be manipulated via mechanical\ndeformations, which opens prospects for studying the Dirac fermions in new\nregimes and for new device applications. Certain natural configurations of\nstrain generate large nearly uniform pseudo-magnetic fields, which have\nopposite signs in the two valleys, and give rise to flat spin- and\nvalley-degenerate pseudo Landau levels (PLLs). Here we consider the effect of\nthe Coulomb interactions in strained graphene with uniform pseudo-magnetic\nfield.

In particular,\nwhen a nonzero PLL is quarter- or three-quarter filled, an anomalous quantum\nHall state spontaneously breaking time-reversal symmetry emerges. At\nhalf-filled PLL, weak spin-orbital interaction stabilizes\ntime-reversal-symmetric quantum spin-Hall state.

{"text": "Scalable Micro-planned Generation of Discourse from Structured Data   We present a framework for generating natural language description from\nstructured data such as tables; the problem comes under the category of\ndata-to-text natural language generation (NLG). Modern data-to-text NLG systems\ntypically employ end-to-end statistical and neural architectures that learn\nfrom a limited amount of task-specific labeled data, and therefore, exhibit\nlimited scalability, domain-adaptability, and interpretability. Unlike these\nsystems, ours is a modular, pipeline-based approach, and does not require\ntask-specific parallel data. It rather relies on monolingual corpora and basic\noff-the-shelf NLP tools. This makes our system more scalable and easily\nadaptable to newer domains.\n  Our system employs a 3-staged pipeline that: (i) converts entries in the\nstructured data to canonical form, (ii) generates simple sentences for each\natomic entry in the canonicalized representation, and (iii) combines the\nsentences to produce a coherent, fluent and adequate paragraph description\nthrough sentence compounding and co-reference replacement modules.

High computational cost is the main obstacle for a more frequent\nonline cascading failure search, which is essential to improve system security.\nIn this work, we show that the complex mechanism of cascading failures can be\nwell captured by training a graph convolutional network (GCN) offline.\nSubsequently, the search of cascading failures can be significantly accelerated\nwith the aid of the trained GCN model. We link the power network topology with\nthe structure of the GCN, yielding a smaller parameter space to learn the\ncomplex mechanism. We further enable the interpretability of the GCN model by a\nlayer-wise relevance propagation (LRP) algorithm.

While recent progress of robotics and computer\nvision has enabled anomaly detection for image classification, anomaly\ndetection on semantic segmentation is less explored. Conventional anomaly-aware\nsystems assuming other existing classes as out-of-distribution (pseudo-unknown)\nclasses for training a model will result in two drawbacks.

One question that\nsystematically recurs is whether information spreads according to simple or\ncomplex dynamics: does each exposure to a piece of information have an\nindependent probability of a user adopting it (simple contagion), or does this\nprobability depend instead on the number of sources of exposure, increasing\nabove some threshold (complex contagion)? Most studies to date are\nobservational and, therefore, unable to disentangle the effects of confounding\nfactors such as social reinforcement, homophily, limited attention, or network\ncommunity structure. Here we describe a novel controlled experiment that we\nperformed on Twitter using `social bots' deployed to carry out coordinated\nattempts at spreading information. We propose two Bayesian statistical models\ndescribing simple and complex contagion dynamics, and test the competing\nhypotheses. We provide experimental evidence that the complex contagion model\ndescribes the observed information diffusion behavior more accurately than\nsimple contagion.

{"text": "The principle of least action for test particles in a four-dimensional\n  spacetime embedded in 5D   It is well known that, in the five-dimensional scenario of braneworld and\nspace-time-mass theories, geodesic motion in 5D is observed to be non-geodesic\nin 4D. Usually, the discussion is purely geometric and based on the dimensional\nreduction of the geodesic equation in 5D, without any reference to the test\nparticle whatsoever. In this work we obtain the equation of motion in 4D\ndirectly from the principle of least action. So our main thrust is not the\ngeometry but the particle observed in 4D. A clear physical picture emerges from\nour work. Specifically, that the deviation from the geodesic motion in 4D is\ndue to the variation of the rest mass of a particle, which is induced by the\nscalar field in the 5D metric and the explicit dependence of the spacetime\nmetric on the extra coordinate. Thus, the principle of least action not only\nleads to the correct equations of motion, but also provides a concrete physical\nmeaning for a number of algebraic quantities appearing in the geometrical\nreduction of the geodesic equation.\n"}

{"text": "One possible explanation for the Balmer and Lyman line shifts in quasars   Internal line shifts in quasars spectra have played a more prominent role in\nour understanding of quasar structure and dynamics. The observed different\nredshift among broad hydrogen lines is still an amazing puzzle in the study of\nquasars. We have argued that the broad hydrogen lines, as well as the\nlow-ionization lines in quasars, are significantly contributed by the Cerenkov\nquasi-line emission of the fast electrons in the dense clouds/filaments/sheets\n($N_{\\rm H}\\geq 10^{14}~{\\rm cm^{-3}}$); whereas this line-like radiation\nmechanism is invalid for producing the high ionization lines. In order to\naccount for redshift difference, the Cerenkov line-like radiation mechanism\ncould provide a plausible resolution: it is the `Cerenkov line redshift', which\nis different from line to line, causes the peculiar redshift-differences among\nLy$\\alpha$, H$\\alpha$ and H$\\beta$ lines. The different redshifts among\ndifferent broad hydrogen lines could stand for an evidence to quantitatively\nsupport that the observed broad hydrogen lines should be blended by both the\nreal line emission and the Cerenkov quasi-line emission. The good fitting to\nthe observed redshifts of quasars confirms the existence of Cerenkov component\nin the broad hydrogen lines, which indicates that, in the blended Ly$\\alpha$\nline, the line-intensity of the Cerenkov component approximately equals that of\nthe accompanying `normal line' (an approximate equipartition of intensity\nbetween the two components in the broad Ly$\\alpha$ line).

We show that Zak's phase can be divided in two\nterms: a global phase required to make the Bloch wave periodic in the Brillouin\nzone and an internal phase which measures the relative delay of the different\nFourier terms within the Brillouin zone. While the former phase is dependent on\nthe origin of coordinates of the unit cell, the latter is independent of it, so\nthat it can be interpreted as an internal property of the band itself. We show\nthat this internal phase is always zero for a symmetric crystal while it can\ntake any value when this symmetry is broken, showing therefore that it can be\ninterpreted as a measure of the assymetry of the band. Since for a symmetric\ncrystal Zak's phase is entirely determined by the global part, we show that\nthis can be easily calculated by means of the parity of the Fourier terms at\nthe center and edge of the Brillouin zone, being therefore unnecessary the\nintegration of the modes through the unit cell and the entire Brillouin zone.\nWe provide numerical examples analyzing the internal part for both electronic\nand classical waves (acoustic or photonic). We analyze the weakest electronic\npotential capable of presenting asymmetry, as well as the double-Dirac delta\npotential, and in both examples it is found that the internal phase varies\ncontinuously as a function of a symmetry-control parameter, but it is zero when\nthe crystal is symmetric. For classical waves, the layered material is\nanalyzed. Although Zak's phase has been mainly studied in connection with the\nexistence of edge states in finite crystals, we consider that the study of the\ninternal phase can be more relevant to understand bulk properties of quantum\nand classical crystals.\n"}

{"text": "Policy Design for Controlling Set-Point Temperature of ACs in Shared\n  Spaces of Buildings   Air conditioning systems are responsible for the major percentage of energy\nconsumption in buildings. Shared spaces constitute considerable office space\narea, in which most office employees perform their meetings and daily tasks,\nand therefore the ACs in these areas have significant impact on the energy\nusage of the entire office building. The cost of this energy consumption,\nhowever, is not paid by the shared space users, and the AC's temperature\nset-point is not determined based on the users' preferences. This latter factor\nis compounded by the fact that different people may have different choices of\ntemperature set-points and sensitivities to change of temperature. Therefore,\nit is a challenging task to design an office policy to decide on a particular\nset-point based on such a diverse preference set. As a result, users are not\naware of the energy consumption in shared spaces, which may potentially\nincrease the energy wastage and related cost of office buildings. In this\ncontext, this paper proposes an energy policy for an office shared space by\nexploiting an established temperature control mechanism. In particular, we\nchoose meeting rooms in an office building as the test case and design a policy\naccording to which each user of the room can give a preference on the\ntemperature set-point and is paid for felt discomfort if the set-point is not\nfixed according to the given preference. On the other hand, users who enjoy the\nthermal comfort compensate the other users of the room. Thus, the policy\nenables the users to be cognizant and responsible for the payment on the energy\nconsumption of the office space they are sharing, and at the same time ensures\nthat the users are satisfied either via thermal comfort or through incentives.\nThe policy is also shown to be beneficial for building management. Through\nexperiment based case studies, we show the effectiveness of the proposed\npolicy.\n"}
{"text": "Numerical experiments on dynamo action in sheared and rotating\n  turbulence   Numerical simulations of forced turbulence in elongated shearing boxes are\ncarried out to demonstrate that a nonhelical turbulence in conjunction with a\nlinear shear can give rise to a mean-field dynamo. Exponential growth of\nmagnetic field at scales larger than the outer (forcing) scale of the\nturbulence is found. Over a range of values of the shearing rate S spanning\napproximately two orders of magnitude, the growth rate of the magnetic field is\nproportional to the imposed shear, gamma ~ S, while the characteristic spatial\nscale of the field is l_b ~ S^(-1/2). The effect is quite general: earlier\nresults for the nonrotating case by Yousef et al. 2008 (PRL 100, 184501) are\nextended to shearing boxes with Keplerian rotation; it is also shown that the\nshear dynamo mechanism operates both below and above the threshold for the\nfluctuation dynamo. The apparently generic nature of the shear dynamo effect\nmakes it an attractive object of study for the purpose of understanding the\ngeneration of magnetic fields in astrophysical systems.\n"}
{"text": "Rapid dissipation of magnetic fields due to Hall current   We propose a mechanism for the fast dissipation of magnetic fields which is\neffective in a stratified medium where ion motions can be neglected. In such a\nmedium, the field is frozen into the electrons and Hall currents prevail.\nAlthough Hall currents conserve magnetic energy, in the presence of density\ngradients, they are able to create current sheets which can be the sites for\nefficient dissipation of magnetic fields. We recover the frequency,\n$\\omega_{MH}$, for Hall oscillations modified by the presence of density\ngradients. We show that these oscillations can lead to the exchange of energy\nbetween different components of the field. We calculate the time evolution and\nshow that magnetic fields can dissipate on a timescale of order\n$1/\\omega_{MH}$. This mechanism can play an important role for magnetic\ndissipation in systems with very steep density gradients where the ions are\nstatic such as those found in the solid crust of neutron stars.\n"}
{"text": "Role of Berry curvature in the generation of spin currents in Rashba\n  systems   We study the background (equilibrium), linear and nonlinear spin currents in\n2D Rashba spin-orbit coupled systems with Zeeman splitting and in 3D\nnoncentrosymmetric metals using modified spin current operator by inclusion of\nthe anomalous velocity. The linear spin Hall current arises due to the\nanomalous velocity of charge carriers induced by the Berry curvature. The\nnonlinear spin current occurs due to the band velocity and/or the anomalous\nvelocity. For 2D Rashba systems, the background spin current saturates at high\nFermi energy (independent of the Zeeman coupling), linear spin current exhibits\na plateau at the Zeeman gap and nonlinear spin currents are peaked at the gap\nedges. The magnitude of the nonlinear spin current peaks enhances with the\nstrength of Zeeman interaction. The linear spin current is polarized out of\nplane, while the nonlinear ones are polarized in-plane. We witness pure\nanomalous nonlinear spin current with spin polarization along the direction of\npropagation. In 3D noncentrosymmetric metals, background and linear spin\ncurrents are monotonically increasing functions of Fermi energy, while\nnonlinear spin currents vary non-monotonically as a function of Fermi energy\nand are independent of the Berry curvature. These findings may provide useful\ninformation to manipulate spin currents in Rashba spin-orbit coupled systems.\n"}
{"text": "Confronting uncertainties in stellar physics II. exploring differences\n  in main-sequence stellar evolution tracks   We assess the systematic uncertainties in stellar evolutionary calculations\nfor low- to intermediate-mass, main-sequence stars. We compare published\nstellar tracks from several different evolution codes with our own tracks\ncomputed using the stellar codes STARS and MESA. In particular, we focus on\ntracks of 1 and 3 solar masses at solar metallicity. We find that the spread in\nthe available 1 solar mass tracks (computed before the recent solar composition\nrevision by Asplund et al.) can be covered by tracks between 0.97-1.01 solar\nmasses computed with the STARS code. We assess some possible causes of the\norigin of this uncertainty, including how the choice of input physics and the\nsolar constraints used to perform the solar calibration affect the tracks. We\nfind that for a 1 solar mass track, uncertainties of around 10% in the initial\nhydrogen abundance and initial metallicity produce around a 2% error in mass.\nFor the 3 solar mass tracks, there is very little difference between the tracks\nfrom the various different stellar codes. The main difference comes in the\nextent of the main sequence, which we believe results from the different\nchoices of the implementation of convective overshooting in the core.\nUncertainties in the initial abundances lead to a 1-2% error in the mass\ndetermination. These uncertainties cover only part of the total error budget,\nwhich should also include uncertainties in the input physics (e.g., reaction\nrates, opacities, convective models) and any missing physics (e.g., radiative\nlevitation, rotation, magnetic fields). Uncertainties in stellar surface\nproperties such as luminosity and effective temperature will further reduce the\naccuracy of any potential mass determinations.\n"}

To train and test SELD\nsystems, datasets of diverse sound events occurring under realistic acoustic\nconditions are needed.

Both\nstatic and moving sound events are synthesized from them. Ambient noise\nrecorded on location is added to complete the generation of scene recordings.

{"text": "FUSE: Multiple Network Alignment via Data Fusion   Discovering patterns in networks of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) is a\ncentral problem in systems biology. Alignments between these networks aid\nfunctional understanding as they uncover important information, such as\nevolutionary conserved pathways, protein complexes and functional orthologs.\nThe objective of a multiple network alignment is to create clusters of nodes\nthat are evolutionarily conserved and functionally consistent across all\nnetworks. Unfortunately, the alignment methods proposed thus far do not fully\nmeet this objective, as they are guided by pairwise scores that do not utilize\nthe entire functional and topological information across all networks. To\novercome this weakness, we propose FUSE, a multiple network aligner that\nutilizes all functional and topological information in all PPI networks. It\nworks in two steps. First, it computes novel similarity scores of proteins\nacross the PPI networks by fusing from all aligned networks both the protein\nwiring patterns and their sequence similarities. It does this by using\nNon-negative Matrix Tri-Factorization (NMTF). When we apply NMTF on the five\nlargest and most complete PPI networks from BioGRID, we show that NMTF finds a\nlarger number of protein pairs across the PPI networks that are functionally\nconserved than can be found by using protein sequence similarities alone. This\ndemonstrates complementarity of protein sequence and their wiring patterns in\nthe PPI networks. In the second step, FUSE uses a novel maximum weight\nk-partite matching approximation algorithm to find an alignment between\nmultiple networks. We compare FUSE with the state of the art multiple network\naligners and show that it produces the largest number of functionally\nconsistent clusters that cover all aligned PPI networks. Also, FUSE is more\ncomputationally efficient than other multiple network aligners.\n"}

Searching for 2D III-V films with high structural stability and\nlarge-gap are crucial for the realizations of dissipationless transport edge\nstates using quantum spin Hall (QSH) effect.

While a vast body\nof research has explored test-time (evasion) attacks in RL and corresponding\ndefenses, its robustness against training-time (poisoning) attacks remains\nlargely unanswered. In this work, we focus on certifying the robustness of\noffline RL in the presence of poisoning attacks, where a subset of training\ntrajectories could be arbitrarily manipulated. We propose the first\ncertification framework, COPA, to certify the number of poisoning trajectories\nthat can be tolerated regarding different certification criteria.

We commence with a pedagogical review of the spinless model and, as\na means of characterizing topological phases exhibited by the systems studied\nhere, we introduce bulk topological invariants as well as those derived from an\nexplicit consideration of boundary modes. In time-reversal invariant systems,\nwe find that the longer range hopping leads to topological phases characterized\nby multiple Majorana modes. In particular, we investigate a spin model, which\nrespects a duality and maps to a fermionic model with multiple Majorana modes;\nwe highlight the connection between these topological phases and the broken\nsymmetry phases in the original spin model. In the presence of time-reversal\nsymmetry breaking terms, we show that the topological phase diagram is\ncharacterized by an extended gapless regime. For the case of inhomogeneous\npotentials, we explore phase diagrams of periodic, quasiperiodic, and\ndisordered systems.

{"text": "Purely dry mergers do not explain the observed evolution of massive\n  early-type galaxies since z = 1   Several studies have suggested that the observed size evolution of massive\nearly-type galaxies (ETGs) can be explained as a combination of dry mergers and\nprogenitor bias, at least since z\\sim1. In this paper we carry out a new test\nof the dry-merger scenario based on recent lensing measurements of the\nevolution of the mass density profile of ETGs. We construct a theoretical model\nfor the joint evolution of the size and mass density profile slope \\gamma'\ndriven by dry mergers occurring at rates given by cosmological simulations.\nSuch dry-merger model predicts a strong decrease of \\gamma' with cosmic time,\ninconsistent with the almost constant \\gamma' inferred from observations in the\nredshift range 0<z<1. We then show with a simple toy model that a modest amount\nof cold gas in the mergers -- consistent with the upper limits on recent star\nformation in ETGs -- is sufficient to reconcile the model with measurements of\n\\gamma'. By fitting for the amount of gas accreted during mergers, we find that\nmodels with dissipation are consistent with observations of the evolution in\nboth size and density slope, if \\sim4% of the total final stellar mass arises\nfrom the gas accreted since z\\sim1. Purely dry merger models are ruled out at >\n99% CL. We thus suggest a scenario where the outer regions of massive ETGs grow\nby accretion of stars and dark matter, while small amounts of dissipation and\nnuclear star formation conspire to keep the mass density profile constant and\napproximately isothermal.\n"}

Reflection is clearly detected in\nall the spectra, but its contribution is larger in the softer X-ray spectra\nseen in outburst than in quiescence. This supports models in which the\nquiescent inner disk is not present or not optically thick, so that the only\nreflector is the white dwarf surface rather than the white dwarf plus the disk.\nWe detect partially ionized absorption in the ASCA outburst spectrum, which is\nprobably the X-ray signature of the outflowing wind. The ASCA data also allow a\ndetailed measure of the elemental abundances. We find that all detectable lines\nfrom the hot plasma (except perhaps Si and S) are a factor $\\sim 2.5\\times$\nweaker than expected from solar abundances. We examine possible deviations from\ncoronal equilibrium, but conclude that the heavy elements are truly\nunderabundant in SS Cyg.\n  In quiescence the underlying intrinsic spectrum is consistent with a single\ntemperature plasma. This conflicts with the expected cooling of the material,\nand requires that either the plasma is reheated or that the cooler emission is\nmasked by absorption in an optically thin inner disk which affects only that\npart of the boundary layer emission below the disk. By contrast, the outburst\nspectrum is much softer and is dominated by the cooling components but has a\ntotal hot plasma luminosity similar to that in quiescence, showing that the\noptically thin plasma emission is important even in outburst.\n"}

We apply the mean-field\nsolar dynamo model to study the reversals of the magnetic helicity sign for the\ndynamo operating in the bulk of the solar convection zone. The evolution of the\nmagnetic helicity is governed by the conservation law. We found that the\nreversal of the sign of the small-scale magnetic helicity follows the dynamo\nwave propagating inside the convection zone. Therefore, the spatial patterns of\nthe magnetic helicity reversals reflect the processes which contribute to\ngeneration and evolution of the large-scale magnetic fields. At the surface the\npatterns of the helicity sign reversals are determined by the magnetic helicity\nboundary conditions at the top of the convection zone.

To\ncope with the higher event rate and efficiently select relevant events from a\nphysics point of view, a new element will be included in the Level-1 Trigger\nscheme after 2015: the Topological Processor (L1Topo). The L1Topo system,\ncurrently developed at CERN, will consist initially of an ATCA crate and two\nL1Topo modules. A high density opto-electroconverter (AVAGO miniPOD) drives up\nto 1.6 Tb/s of data from the calorimeter and muon detectors into two high-end\nFPGA (Virtex7-690), to be processed in about 200 ns. The design has been\noptimized to guarantee excellent signal in- tegrity of the high-speed links and\nlow latency data transmission on the Real Time Data Path (RTDP).

{"text": "Trispectrum versus Bispectrum in Single-Field Inflation   In the standard slow-roll inflationary cosmology, quantum fluctuations in a\nsingle field, the inflaton, generate approximately Gaussian primordial density\nperturbations. At present, the bispectrum and trispectrum of the density\nperturbations have not been observed and the probability distribution for these\nperturbations is consistent with Gaussianity. However, Planck satellite data\nwill bring a new level of precision to bear on this issue, and it is possible\nthat evidence for non-Gaussian effects in the primordial distribution will be\ndiscovered. One possibility is that a trispectrum will be observed without\nevidence for a non-zero bispectrum. It is not difficult for this to occur in\ninflationary models where quantum fluctuations in a field other than the\ninflaton contribute to the density perturbations. A natural question to ask is\nwhether such an observation would rule out the standard scenarios. We explore\nthis issue and find that it is possible to construct single-field models in\nwhich inflaton-generated primordial density perturbations have an observable\ntrispectrum, but a bispectrum that is too small to be observed by the Planck\nsatellite. However, an awkward fine tuning seems to be unavoidable.\n"}

{"text": "Physical Parameters of Late-type Contact Binaries in the Northern\n  Catalina Sky Survey   We present the physical parameters of 2335 late-type contact binary (CB)\nsystems extracted from the Catalina Sky Survey (CSS). Our sample was selected\nfrom the CSS Data Release 1 by strictly limiting the prevailing temperature\nuncertainties and light-curve fitting residuals, allowing us to almost\neliminate any possible contaminants. We developed an automatic\nWilson--Devinney-type code to derive the relative properties of CBs based on\ntheir light-curve morphology. By adopting the distances derived from CB\n(orbital) period--luminosity relations (PLRs), combined with the well-defined\nmass--luminosity relation for the systems' primary stars and assuming solar\nmetallicity, we calculated the objects' masses, radii, and luminosities. Our\nsample of fully eclipsing CBs contains 1530 W-, 710 A-, and 95 B-type CBs. A\ncomparison with literature data and with the results from different surveys\nconfirms the accuracy and coherence of our measurements. The period\ndistributions of the various CB subtypes are different, hinting at a possible\nevolutionary sequence. W-type CBs are clearly located in a strip in the total\nmass versus mass ratio plane, while A-type CBs may exhibit a slightly different\ndependence. There are no significant differences among the PLRs of A- and\nW-type CBs, but the PLR zero points are affected by their mass ratios and\nfill-out factors.

Using laser guide star adaptive optics in conjunction with\nthe integral field spectrograph, OSIRIS, at the Keck II telescope, we are able\nto differentiate between the older, late-type (~ 1 Gyr) stars, which are\npresumed to be dynamically relaxed, and the unrelaxed young (~ 6 Myr)\npopulation. This distinction is crucial for testing models of stellar cusp\nformation in the vicinity of a black hole, as the models assume that the cusp\nstars are in dynamical equilibrium in the black hole potential. We find that\ncontamination from young stars is significant, with more than twice as many\nyoung stars as old stars in our sensitivity range (K < 15.5) within the central\narcsecond. Based on the late-type stars alone, the surface stellar number\ndensity profile, is flat, with a projected power law slope of -0.26+-0.24.\nThese results are consistent with the nuclear star cluster having no cusp, with\na core profile that is significantly flatter than predicted by most cusp\nformation theories.

We explore this intuition by studying the injectivity and\nsurjectivity of the comparison map, for which surprisingly general statements\nare available.

{"text": "Quasicontinuum Method Extended to Irregular Lattices   The quasicontinuum (QC) method, originally proposed by Tadmor, Ortiz and\nPhillips in 1996, is a computational technique that can efficiently handle\nregular atomistic lattices by combining continuum and atomistic approaches. In\nthe present work, the QC method is extended to irregular systems of particles\nthat represent a heterogeneous material. The paper introduces five QC-inspired\napproaches that approximate a discrete model consisting of particles connected\nby elastic links with axial interactions. Accuracy is first checked on simple\nexamples in two and three spatial dimensions. Computational efficiency is then\nassessed by performing three-dimensional simulations of an L-shaped specimen\nwith elastic-brittle links. It is shown that the QC-inspired approaches\nsubstantially reduce the computational cost and lead to macroscopic crack\ntrajectories and global load-displacement curves that are very similar to those\nobtained by a fully resolved particle model.\n"}

{"text": "Resolvent Analysis for Turbulent Channel Flow with Riblets   This paper extends the resolvent formalism for wall turbulence proposed by\nMcKeon and Sharma(2010) to account for the effect of streamwise-constant\nriblets. Under the resolvent formulation, the Navier-Stokes equations are\ninterpreted as a forcing-response system: the nonlinear convective term is\ninterpreted as a feedback forcing on the remaining linear terms, which\ngenerates a velocity and pressure response. A gain-based decomposition of the\nlinear forcing-response transfer function --- the resolvent operator --- yields\nhighly amplified velocity and pressure modes, which can be considered key\nbuilding blocks of the turbulent flow field. Previous work has shown that these\nhigh-gain modes provide substantial insight into turbulence statistics,\nstructure, and control of smooth-walled flows. To introduce the effect of\nriblets within this framework, a linear spatially-varying body force is added\nto the governing equations. In other words, volume penalization is used to\napproximate the surface features. Predictions for spanwise-periodic and\nstreamwise-constant riblets show that specific high-gain modes identified from\nthe modified governing equations reproduce observations made in prior direct\nnumerical simulations with limited computation. The deterioration in\nperformance with increasing riblet size is predicted well and so is the\nemergence of spanwise rollers resembling Kelvin-Helmholtz vortices. This new\nmodeling framework is also used to pursue limited riblet shape optimization.\n"}

In turn, this implies that, at any given\nradius, the dark mass enclosed by a galaxy must exceed a certain minimum. We\nuse rotation curves of dwarf galaxies compiled from the literature to explore\nwhether their enclosed mass is consistent with these constraints. We find that\nalmost one half of the dwarfs in our sample with stellar mass between 10^6-10^7\nM_sun are at odds with this restriction: either they live in halos with masses\nsubstantially below 10^10 M_sun or there is a mechanism capable of reducing the\ndark mass enclosed by some of the faintest dwarfs. Neither possibility is\neasily accommodated within the standard LCDM scenario.

We show that\namenable groups are DJ and that the DJ property is preserved under direct\nproducts. We define a simple dynamical condition DDJ on minimal systems, which\nis a strengthening of the Gottchalk-Hedlund property, and we say that a group\n$G$ is DDJ if every minimal $G$-system has this property. The DJ property\nimplies DDJ and by means of an intricate construction we show that every\nfinitely generated DDJ group is also DJ. Residually finite, maximally almost\nperiodic and $C^*$-simple groups are all DDJ. Finally we show that\nFurstenberg's conjecture holds for every DDJ group.\n"}

{"text": "Engineered dissipation induced entanglement transition in quantum spin\n  chains: from logarithmic growth to area law   Recent theoretical work has shown that the competition between coherent\nunitary dynamics and stochastic measurements, performed by the environment,\nalong wavefunction trajectories can give rise to transitions in the\nentanglement scaling. In this work, complementary to these previous studies, we\nanalyze a situation where the role of Hamiltonian and dissipative dynamics is\nreversed. We consider an engineered dissipation, which stabilizes an entangled\nphase of a quantum spin$-1/2$ chain, while competing single-particle or\ninteracting Hamiltonian dynamics induce a disentangled phase. Focusing on the\nsingle-particle unitary dynamics, we find that the system undergoes an\nentanglement transition from a logarithmic growth to an area law when the\ncompetition ratio between the unitary evolution and the non-unitary dynamics\nincreases. We evidence that the transition manifests itself in state-dependent\nobservables at a finite competition ratio for Hamiltonian and measurement\ndynamics. On the other hand, it is absent in trajectory-averaged steady-state\ndynamics, governed by a Lindblad master equation: although purely dissipative\ndynamics stabilizes an entangled state, for any non-vanishing Hamiltonian\ncontribution the system ends up irremediably in a disordered phase. In\naddition, a single trajectory analysis reveals that the distribution of the\nentanglement entropy constitutes an efficient indicator of the transition.\nComplementarily, we explore the competition of the dissipation with coherent\ndynamics generated by an interacting Hamiltonian, and demonstrate that the\nentanglement transition also occurs in this second model. Our results suggest\nthat this type of transition takes place for a broader class of Hamiltonians,\nunderlining its robustness in monitored open quantum many-body systems.\n"}

{"text": "An inertia 'paradox' for incompressible stratified Euler fluids   The interplay between incompressibility and stratification can lead to\nnon-conservation of horizontal momentum in the dynamics of a stably stratified\nincompressible Euler fluid filling an infinite horizontal channel between rigid\nupper and lower plates. Lack of conservation occurs even though in this\nconfiguration only vertical external forces act on the system. This apparent\nparadox was seemingly first noticed by Benjamin (J. Fluid Mech., vol. 165,\n1986, pp. 445-474) in his classification of the invariants by symmetry groups\nwith the Hamiltonian structure of the Euler equations in two dimensional\nsettings, but it appears to have been largely ignored since. By working\ndirectly with the motion equations, the paradox is shown here to be a\nconsequence of the rigid lid constraint coupling through incompressibility with\nthe infinite inertia of the far ends of the channel, assumed to be at rest in\nhydrostatic equilibrium. Accordingly, when inertia is removed by eliminating\nthe stratification, or, remarkably, by using the Boussinesq approximation of\nuniform density for the inertia terms, horizontal momentum conservation is\nrecovered. This interplay between constraints,action at a distance by\nincompressibility, and inertia is illustrated by layer-averaged exact results,\ntwo-layer long-wave models, and direct numerical simulations of the\nincompressible Euler equations with smooth stratification.\n"}

However, our abundances of C, Sc, Ti, Cr,\nMn and Co are ~0.2 dex larger than in giants of similar metallicity.

{"text": "Uncertainty-Aware Resource Provisioning for Network Slicing   Network slicing allows Mobile Network Operators to split the physical\ninfrastructure into isolated virtual networks (slices), managed by Service\nProviders to accommodate customized services. The Service Function Chains\n(SFCs) belonging to a slice are usually deployed on a best-effort premise:\nnothing guarantees that network infrastructure resources will be sufficient to\nsupport a varying number of users, each with uncertain requirements. Taking the\nperspective of a network Infrastructure Provider (InP), this paper proposes a\nresource provisioning approach for slices, robust to a partly unknown number of\nusers with random usage of the slice resources. The provisioning scheme aims to\nmaximize the total earnings of the InP, while providing a probabilistic\nguarantee that the amount of provisioned network resources will meet the slice\nrequirements. Moreover, the proposed provisioning approach is performed so as\nto limit its impact on low-priority background services, which may co-exist\nwith slices in the infrastructure network. A Mixed Integer Linear Programming\nformulation of the slice resource provisioning problem is proposed. Optimal\njoint and suboptimal sequential solutions are proposed. These solutions are\ncompared to a provisioning scheme that does not account for best-effort\nservices sharing the common infrastructure network.\n"}
{"text": "Nature of Spin Hall Effect in a finite Ballistic Two-Dimensional System\n  with Rashba and Dresselhaus spin-orbit interaction   The spin Hall effect in a finite ballistic two-dimensional system with Rashba\nand Dresselhaus spin-orbit interaction is studied numerically. We find that the\nspin Hall conductance is very sensitive to the transverse measuring location,\nthe shape and size of the device, and the strength of the spin-orbit\ninteraction. Not only the amplitude of spin Hall conductance but also its sign\ncan change. This non-universal behavior of the spin Hall effect is essentially\ndifferent from that of the charge Hall effect, in which the Hall voltage is\nalmost invariant with the transverse measuring site and is a monotonic function\nof the strength of the magnetic field. These surprise behavior of the spin Hall\nconductance are attributed to the fact that the eigenstates of the spin Hall\nsystem is extended in the transverse direction and do not form the edge states.\n"}

To this aim, twelve participants perform an\naction similarity task, and their performances are compared to that of a\ncomputational model solving the same task.

A possible reason for this is the\nparticular sensitivity of the model towards kinematic primitives of the\npresented actions.

As a consequence\nof this separation, the associated spectral function exhibits a narrow\nstructure in the small frequency region which controls the dynamics of\ntransport in the theory and may be described as a transport peak typically\nfound in perturbative, weakly interacting thermal field theories.

Calibrate\n  Parameters for One-dimensional Reynolds Stress Model   In this paper, we calibrate the coefficients for the one-dimensional Reynolds\nstress model with the data generated from the three-dimensional numerical\nsimulations of upward overshooting in turbulent compressible convection. It has\nbeen found that the calibrated convective and isotropic coefficients are almost\nthe same as those calibrated in the pure convection zone. However, the\ncalibrated diffusive coefficients differ significantly from those calibrated in\nthe pure convection zone. We suspect that the diffusive effect induced by the\nboundary is stronger than by the adjacent stable zone. We have checked the\nvalidity of the downgradient approximation.

{"text": "Randomized Block Frank-Wolfe for Convergent Large-Scale Learning   Owing to their low-complexity iterations, Frank-Wolfe (FW) solvers are well\nsuited for various large-scale learning tasks. When block-separable constraints\nare present, randomized block FW (RB-FW) has been shown to further reduce\ncomplexity by updating only a fraction of coordinate blocks per iteration. To\ncircumvent the limitations of existing methods, the present work develops step\nsizes for RB-FW that enable a flexible selection of the number of blocks to\nupdate per iteration while ensuring convergence and feasibility of the\niterates. To this end, convergence rates of RB-FW are established through\ncomputational bounds on a primal sub-optimality measure and on the duality gap.\nThe novel bounds extend the existing convergence analysis, which only applies\nto a step-size sequence that does not generally lead to feasible iterates.\nFurthermore, two classes of step-size sequences that guarantee feasibility of\nthe iterates are also proposed to enhance flexibility in choosing decay rates.\nThe novel convergence results are markedly broadened to encompass also\nnonconvex objectives, and further assert that RB-FW with exact line-search\nreaches a stationary point at rate $\\mathcal{O}(1/\\sqrt{t})$. Performance of\nRB-FW with different step sizes and number of blocks is demonstrated in two\napplications, namely charging of electrical vehicles and structural support\nvector machines.

{"text": "A general formulation of time-optimal quantum control and optimality of\n  singular protocols   We present a general theoretical framework for finding the time-optimal\nunitary evolution of the quantum systems when the Hamiltonian is subject to\narbitrary constraints. Quantum brachistochrone (QB) is such a framework based\non the variational principle, whose drawback is that it deals with equality\nconstraints only. While inequality constraints can be reduced to equality ones\nin some situations, there are situations where they cannot, especially when a\ndrift field is present in the Hamiltonian. The drift which we cannot control\nappears in a wide range of systems. We first develop a framework based on\nPontryagin's maximum principle (MP) in order to deal with inequality\nconstraints as well. The new framework contains QB as a special case, and their\ndetailed correspondence is given. Second, using this framework, we discuss\ngeneral relations among the drift, the singular controls, and the inequality\nconstraints. The singular controls are those that satisfy MP trivially so as to\ncause a trouble in determining the optimal protocol. Third, to overcome this\nissue, we derive an additional necessary condition for a singular protocol to\nbe optimal by applying the generalized Legendre-Clebsch condition. This\ncondition in particular reveals the physical meaning of singular controls.\nFinally, we demonstrate how our framework and results work in some examples.\n"}

The large-area (quasi-)vdW epitaxy of layered 2D chalcogenides is\nconsequently carefully being researched since these materials hold very\npromising properties for future nanoelectronic applications. The formation of\ndefects such as stacking faults like 60o twins and consequently 60o grain\nboundaries is still of major concern for the defect-free epitaxial growth of 2D\nchalcogenides. Although growth strategies to overcome the occurrence of these\ndefects are currently being considered, more fundamental understanding on the\norigin of these defects at the initial stages of the growth is highly\nessential. Therefore this work focuses on the understanding of 60o twin\nformation in (quasi-)vdW epitaxy of 2D chalcogenides relying on systematic\nmolecular beam epitaxy (MBE) experiments supported by density functional theory\n(DFT) calculations. The MBE experiments reveal the striking difference in 60o\ntwin formation between WSe2 and Bi2Se3 in both quasi-vdW heteroepitaxy and vdW\nhomoepitaxy, which from our DFT calculations links to the difference in\ninterlayer vdW coupling strength. The stronger interlayer vdW coupling in\nBi2Se3 compared to WSe2 results in a striking enhanced control on twin\nformation and hence shows significantly more promise for defect-free epitaxial\nintegration. This interesting aspect of (quasi-)vdW epitaxy reveals that the\nstrength of interlayer vdW coupling is key for functional 2D materials and\nopens perspectives for other vdW materials sharing strong interlayer\ninteractions.\n"}

{"text": "Meta-Learning without Memorization   The ability to learn new concepts with small amounts of data is a critical\naspect of intelligence that has proven challenging for deep learning methods.\nMeta-learning has emerged as a promising technique for leveraging data from\nprevious tasks to enable efficient learning of new tasks. However, most\nmeta-learning algorithms implicitly require that the meta-training tasks be\nmutually-exclusive, such that no single model can solve all of the tasks at\nonce. For example, when creating tasks for few-shot image classification, prior\nwork uses a per-task random assignment of image classes to N-way classification\nlabels. If this is not done, the meta-learner can ignore the task training data\nand learn a single model that performs all of the meta-training tasks\nzero-shot, but does not adapt effectively to new image classes. This\nrequirement means that the user must take great care in designing the tasks,\nfor example by shuffling labels or removing task identifying information from\nthe inputs. In some domains, this makes meta-learning entirely inapplicable. In\nthis paper, we address this challenge by designing a meta-regularization\nobjective using information theory that places precedence on data-driven\nadaptation. This causes the meta-learner to decide what must be learned from\nthe task training data and what should be inferred from the task testing input.\nBy doing so, our algorithm can successfully use data from\nnon-mutually-exclusive tasks to efficiently adapt to novel tasks.

{"text": "Multi-Task Representation Learning with Multi-View Graph Convolutional\n  Networks   Link prediction and node classification are two important downstream tasks of\nnetwork representation learning. Existing methods have achieved acceptable\nresults but they perform these two tasks separately, which requires a lot of\nduplication of work and ignores the correlations between tasks. Besides,\nconventional models suffer from the identical treatment of information of\nmultiple views, thus they fail to learn robust representation for downstream\ntasks. To this end, we tackle link prediction and node classification problems\nsimultaneously via multi-task multi-view learning in this paper. We first\nexplain the feasibility and advantages of multi-task multi-view learning for\nthese two tasks. Then we propose a novel model named as MT-MVGCN to perform\nlink prediction and node classification tasks simultaneously. More\nspecifically, we design a multi-view graph convolutional network to extract\nabundant information of multiple views in a network, which is shared by\ndifferent tasks. We further apply two attention mechanisms: view attention\nmechanism and task attention mechanism to make views and tasks adjust the view\nfusion process. Moreover, view reconstruction can be introduced as an auxiliary\ntask to boost the performance of the proposed model. Experiments on real-world\nnetwork datasets demonstrate that our model is efficient yet effective, and\noutperforms advanced baselines in these two tasks.\n"}

MD simulations follow the detailed motion of sets of interacting\natoms through integration of atomic equations of motion, using inter-atomic\npotentials that can account for bond breaking and formation that result when\nenergetic species from the plasma impact surfaces. This article summarizes the\ncurrent status of the technique for various applications of low temperature\nplasmas to material processing technologies. The method is reviewed, and\ncommonly used inter-atomic potentials are described.

{"text": "Real Space Invariants: Twisted Bulk-Boundary Correspondence of Fragile\n  Topology   In this paper, we propose a new type of bulk-boundary correspondence as a\ngeneric approach to theoretically and experimentally detect fragile topological\nstates. When the fragile phase can be written as a difference of a trivial\natomic insulator and the so-called obstructed atomic insulator, the gap between\nthe fragile phase and other bands must close under a specific novel twist of\nthe boundary condition of the system. We explicitly work out all the twisted\nboundary conditions (TBC) that can detect all the 2D fragile phases implied by\nsymmetry eigenvalues in all wallpaper groups. We develop the concept of real\nspace invariants - local good quantum numbers in real space - which fully\ncharacterize the eigenvalue fragile phases. We show that the number of\nunavoidable level crossings under the twisted boundary condition is completely\ndetermined by the real space invariants. Possible realizations of the TBC of\nthe fragile band in metamaterial systems are discussed.\n"}
{"text": "Dynamics of a prominence-horn structure during its evaporation in the\n  solar corona   The physical connection among and formation mechanisms of various components\nof the prominence-horn cavity system remain elusive. Here we present\nobservations of such a system, focusing on a section of the prominence that\nrises and separates gradually from the main body. This forms a configuration\nsufficiently simple to yield clues to the above issues. It is characterized by\nembedding horns, oscillations, and a gradual disappearance of the separated\nmaterial. The prominence-horn structure exhibits a large amplitude longitudinal\noscillation with a period of ~150 minutes and an amplitude of ~30 Mm along the\ntrajectory defined by the concave horn structure. The horns also experience a\nsimultaneous transverse oscillation with a much smaller amplitude (~3 Mm) and\nshorter period (~10-15 minutes), likely representative of a global mode of the\nlarge-scale magnetic structure. The gradual disappearance of the structure\nindicates that the horn, an observational manifestation of the field-aligned\ntransition region separating the cool and dense prominence from the hot and\ntenuous corona, is formed due to the heating and diluting process of the\ncentral prominence mass, while most previous studies suggest that it is the\nopposite process, i.e., the cooling and condensation of coronal plasmas, to\nform the horn. This study also demonstrates how the prominence transports\nmagnetic flux to the upper corona, a process essential for the gradual build-up\nof pre-eruption magnetic energy.\n"}

{"text": "Observational tests of the black hole area increase law   The black hole area theorem implies that when two black holes merge, the area\nof the final black hole should be greater than the sum of the areas of the two\noriginal black holes.

By separately fitting\nthe early inspiral and final ringdown stages, we calculate the posterior\ndistributions for the masses and spins of the two initial and the final black\nholes.

{"text": "Blocked and Hierarchical Disentangled Representation From Information\n  Theory Perspective   We propose a novel and theoretical model, blocked and hierarchical\nvariational autoencoder (BHiVAE), to get better-disentangled representation. It\nis well known that information theory has an excellent explanatory meaning for\nthe network, so we start to solve the disentanglement problem from the\nperspective of information theory. BHiVAE mainly comes from the information\nbottleneck theory and information maximization principle. Our main idea is that\n(1) Neurons block not only one neuron node is used to represent attribute,\nwhich can contain enough information; (2) Create a hierarchical structure with\ndifferent attributes on different layers, so that we can segment the\ninformation within each layer to ensure that the final representation is\ndisentangled. Furthermore, we present supervised and unsupervised BHiVAE,\nrespectively, where the difference is mainly reflected in the separation of\ninformation between different blocks. In supervised BHiVAE, we utilize the\nlabel information as the standard to separate blocks. In unsupervised BHiVAE,\nwithout extra information, we use the Total Correlation (TC) measure to achieve\nindependence, and we design a new prior distribution of the latent space to\nguide the representation learning. It also exhibits excellent disentanglement\nresults in experiments and superior classification accuracy in representation\nlearning.\n"}

Widely used Linear Programming (LP) relaxations only work well\nwhen networks are trained to facilitate verification. This precludes\napplications that involve verification-agnostic networks, i.e., networks not\nspecially trained for verification. On the other hand, semidefinite programming\n(SDP) relaxations have successfully be applied to verification-agnostic\nnetworks, but do not currently scale beyond small networks due to poor time and\nspace asymptotics. In this work, we propose a first-order dual SDP algorithm\nthat (1) requires memory only linear in the total number of network\nactivations, (2) only requires a fixed number of forward/backward passes\nthrough the network per iteration. By exploiting iterative eigenvector methods,\nwe express all solver operations in terms of forward and backward passes\nthrough the network, enabling efficient use of hardware like GPUs/TPUs.

The contributions from two-nucleon\nforces are computed in many-body perturbation theory to first and second order\n(without any simplifying approximations). In addition we include the\nleading-order one-loop diagrams from the N2LO chiral three-nucleon force, which\ncontribute to all Fermi liquid parameters except those associated with the\ncenter-of-mass tensor interaction. The relative-momentum dependence of the\nquasiparticle interaction is expanded in Legendre polynomials up to L=2.\nSecond-order Pauli blocking and medium polarization effects act coherently in\nspecific channels, namely for the Landau parameters f_1, h_0 and g_0, which\nresults in a dramatic increase in the quasiparticle effective mass as well as a\ndecrease in both the effective tensor force and the neutron matter spin\nsusceptibility. For densities greater than about half nuclear matter saturation\ndensity \\rho_0, the contributions to the Fermi liquid parameters from the\nleading-order chiral three-nucleon force scale in all cases approximately\nlinearly with the nucleon density. The largest effect of the three-nucleon\nforce is to generate a strongly repulsive effective interaction in the\nisotropic spin-independent channel. We show that the leading-order chiral\nthree-nucleon force leads to an increase in the spin susceptibility of neutron\nmatter, but we observe no evidence for a ferromagnetic spin instability in the\nvicinity of the saturation density \\rho_0.

We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in the\ndomain of driving simulations, where we learn maneuvers in two scenarios. Our\nlearned controller can dynamically select actions along a continuous axis,\nwhere safe and conservative behaviors are found at one end while riskier\nbehaviors are found at the other.

The source reached its\nbrightest level, R = 12.5, in the fourteen years of our study in August 2001,\nat which time it became unobservable due to its proximity to the Sun. Upon\nbecoming observable again in mid-December 2001, 3C 279 fluctuated between R =\n13.9 and R = 14.7, until a dramatic decrease in flux level in June-July 2002\nbrought the source back down to a level comparable to its pre-outburst state.\nThe source exhibited numerous week-long flares of approximately one magnitude\nduring the outburst period.

{"text": "Kinetics of target site localization of a protein on DNA: a stochastic\n  approach   It is widely recognized that the cleaving rate of a restriction enzyme on\ntarget DNA sequences is several orders of magnitude faster than the maximal one\ncalculated from the diffusion--limited theory. It was therefore commonly\nassumed that the target site interaction of a restriction enzyme with DNA has\nto occur via two steps: one--dimensional diffusion along a DNA segment, and\nlong--range jumps coming from association/dissociation events. We propose here\na stochastic model for this reaction which comprises a series of 1D diffusions\nof a restriction enzyme on non-specific DNA sequences interrupted by 3D\nexcursions in the solution until the target sequence is reached. This model\nprovides an optimal finding strategy which explains the fast association rate.\nModeling the excursions by uncorrelated random jumps, we recover the expression\nof the mean time required for target site association to occur given by Berg &\nal. \\cite{berg81}, and we explicitly give several physical quantities\ndescribing the stochastic pathway of the enzyme. For competitive target sites\nwe calculate two quantities: processivity and preference.

{"text": "Towards reliable projections of global mean surface temperature   Quantifying the risk of global warming exceeding critical targets such as 2.0\nK requires reliable projections of uncertainty as well as best estimates of\nGlobal Mean Surface Temperature (GMST). However, uncertainty bands on GMST\nprojections are often calculated heuristically and have several potential\nshortcomings. In particular, the uncertainty bands shown in IPCC plume\nprojections of GMST are based on the distribution of GMST anomalies from\nclimate model runs and so are strongly determined by model characteristics with\nlittle influence from observations of the real-world. Physically motivated\ntime-series approaches are proposed based on fitting energy balance models\n(EBMs) to climate model outputs and observations in order to constrain future\nprojections. It is shown that EBMs fitted to one forcing scenario will not\nproduce reliable projections when different forcing scenarios are applied. The\nerrors in the EBM projections can be interpreted as arising due to a\ndiscrepancy in the effective forcing felt by the model. A simple time-series\napproach to correcting the projections is proposed based on learning the\nevolution of the forcing discrepancy so that it can be projected into the\nfuture. These approaches give reliable projections of GMST when tested in a\nperfect model setting, and when applied to observations lead to well\nconstrained projections with lower mean warming and narrower projection bands\nthan previous estimates. Despite the reduced uncertainty, the lower warming\nleads to a greatly reduced probability of exceeding the 2.0 K warming target.\n"}

We characterize the phase and\nrelative amplitude variations using analytical and numerical tools. When the\nforcing is internal the phase variation displays a random walk behaviour and a\nred noise power spectrum with a ragged erratic appearance. We determine the\ndependence of the root mean square phase and relative amplitude variations\n($\\sigma_{\\Delta \\varphi}$ and $\\sigma_{\\Delta A/A}$, respectively) on the\namplitude of the stochastic perturbations, the damping constant $\\eta$, and the\ntotal observation time $t_{\\rm obs}$ for this case, under the assumption that\nthe relative amplitude variations remain small, showing that $\\sigma_{\\Delta\n\\varphi}$ increases with $t_{\\rm obs}^{1/2}$ becoming much larger than\n$\\sigma_{\\Delta A/A}$ for $t_{\\rm obs} \\gg \\eta^{-1}$.

{"text": "The Virtual Emotion Loop: Towards Emotion-Driven Services via Virtual\n  Reality   The importance of emotions in service and in product design is well known.\nHowever, it is still not very well understood how users' emotions can be\nincorporated in a product or service lifecycle.

Indeed, the\nemotional response of users is generally investigated by means of methods\n(e.g., surveys) that are not effective for this purpose.

{"text": "The Resource Theory of Quantum States Out of Thermal Equilibrium   The ideas of thermodynamics have proved fruitful in the setting of quantum\ninformation theory, in particular the notion that when the allowed\ntransformations of a system are restricted, certain states of the system become\nuseful resources with which one can prepare previously inaccessible states. The\ntheory of entanglement is perhaps the best-known and most well-understood\nresource theory in this sense. Here we return to the basic questions of\nthermodynamics using the formalism of resource theories developed in quantum\ninformation theory and show that the free energy of thermodynamics emerges\nnaturally from the resource theory of energy-preserving transformations.\nSpecifically, the free energy quantifies the amount of useful work which can be\nextracted from asymptotically-many copies of a quantum system when using only\nreversible energy-preserving transformations and a thermal bath at fixed\ntemperature. The free energy also quantifies the rate at which resource states\ncan be reversibly interconverted asymptotically, provided that a sublinear\namount of coherent superposition over energy levels is available, a situation\nanalogous to the sublinear amount of classical communication required for\nentanglement dilution.\n"}

Using measurements of ultraviolet (UV) and\noptical spectral lines, multi-band photometric data, and stellar population\nmodels we statistically assess possible correlations between galaxy morphology\nand physical observables such as stellar mass, star formation rate, and the\nstrength of galaxy-scale outflows.

We find\nthat the damping-like spin-orbit torque decreases substantially for all samples\nwith a spacer layer compared to the reference Pt/Co bilayer, consistently with\nthe opposite sign of the atomic spin-orbit coupling constant of the spacer\nelements relative to Pt. The reduction of the damping-like torque is monotonic\nwith atomic number for the isoelectronic 3d, 4d, and 5d elements, with the\nexception of V that has a stronger effect than Cr.

{"text": "The dynamics of dense particles in vertical channel flows: gravity, lift\n  and particle clusters   The dynamics of dense finite-size particles in vertical channel flows of\nNewtonian and viscoelastic carrier fluids are examined using particle resolved\nsimulations. Comparison to neutrally buoyant particles in the same\nconfiguration highlights the effect of settling. The particle volume fraction\nis $5\\%$, and a gravity field acts counter to the flow direction. Despite a\nmodest density ratio ($\\rho_r = 1.15$), qualitative changes arise due to the\nrelative velocity between the particle and fluid phases. While dense particles\nare homogeneously distributed in the core of the channel, the mean\nconcentration profile peaks in the near-wall region due to a competition\nbetween shear- and rotation-induced lift forces. These forces act in the\ncross-stream directions, and are analyzed by evaluating conditional averages\nalong individual particle trajectories. The correlation between the angular and\ntranslational velocities of the particles highlights the significance of the\nMagnus lift force in both the spanwise and wall-normal directions. The\ncollective behaviour of the particles is also intriguing. Using a \\Voro\nanalysis, strong clustering is identified in dense particles near the wall,\nwhich is shown to alter their streamwise velocities. This clustering is\nattributed to the preferential transport of aggregated particles towards the\nwall. The practical implication of the non-uniformity of particle distribution\nis a significant increase in drag. When the carrier fluid is viscoelastic, the\nparticle migration is enhanced which leads to larger stresses, thus negating\nthe capacity of viscoelasticity to reduce turbulent drag.\n"}

For these stars, the heavy\nelement abundances cannot be explained either by s-process or r-process\nnucleosynthesis alone, as the production sites of s- and r-process elements are\nvery different, and these two processes produce distinct abundance patterns.\nThus, the observational evidence of the double enhancement seen in CEMP-r/s\nstars remains a puzzle as far as the origin of the elements is concerned. In\nthis work, we have critically analysed the observed abundances of heavy\nelements in a sample of eight CEMP-r/s stars from literature, to trace the\norigin of the observed double enhancement. Towards this, we have conducted a\nparametric-model based analysis to delineate the contributions of s- and\nr-process nucleosynthesis to the observed elemental abundances.

One possibility is that these planets formed in a circumbinary disc\nwhose midplane was inclined relative to the binary orbital plane.

Band selection has\nbeen proven effective in avoiding such problems by removing the redundant\nbands. However, many of existing band selection methods separately estimate the\nsignificance for every single band and cannot fully consider the nonlinear and\nglobal interaction between spectral bands. In this paper, by assuming that a\ncomplete HSI can be reconstructed from its few informative bands, we propose a\ngeneral band selection framework, Band Selection Network (termed as BS-Net).\nThe framework consists of a band attention module (BAM), which aims to\nexplicitly model the nonlinear inter-dependencies between spectral bands, and a\nreconstruction network (RecNet), which is used to restore the original HSI cube\nfrom the learned informative bands, resulting in a flexible architecture.

Here, we studied the\norigin of modularity and sparseness focusing on the nature of the mutation\nprocess, rather than on connection cost or variations in the goal.

{"text": "Long-Timescale Magnetization Ordering Induced by an Adsorbed Chiral\n  Monolayer on Ferromagnets   When an electron passes through a chiral molecule there is a high probability\nfor a correlation between the momentum and spin of the charge, thus leading to\nspin polarized current. This phenomenon is known as the chiral induced spin\nselectivity (CISS) effect. One of the most surprising experimental results\nrecently demonstrated is that magnetization reversal in a ferromagnet (FM) with\nperpendicular anisotropy can be realized solely by chemisorbing a chiral\nmolecular monolayer without applying any current or external magnetic field.\nThis result raises the currently open question of whether this effect is due to\nthe bonding event, held by the ferromagnet, or a long timescale effect\nstabilized by exchange interactions. In this work we have performed vectorial\nmagnetic field measurements of the magnetization reorientation of a\nferromagnetic layer exhibiting perpendicular anisotropy due to CISS using\nnitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond, and followed the time dynamics of this\neffect. In parallel, we have measured the molecular monolayer tilt angle in\norder to find a correlation between the time dependence of the magnetization\nre-orientation and the change of the tilt angle of the molecular monolayer. We\nhave identified that changes in the magnetization direction correspond to\nchanges of the molecular monolayer tilt angle, providing evidence for a\nlong-timescale characteristic of the induced magnetization reorientation. This\nsuggests that the CISS effect has an effect over long-timescales which we\nattribute to exchange interactions. These results offer significant insights\ninto the fundamental processes underlying the CISS effect, contributing to the\nimplementation of CISS in state-of-the-art applications such as spintronic and\nmagnetic memory devices.\n"}
{"text": "Robust Optimization with Decision-Dependent Information Discovery   Robust optimization is a popular paradigm for modeling and solving two- and\nmulti-stage decision-making problems affected by uncertainty. Most approaches\nassume that the uncertain parameters can be observed for free and that the\nsequence in which they are revealed is independent of the decision-maker's\nactions. Yet, these assumptions fail to hold in many real-world applications\nwhere the time of information discovery is decision-dependent and the uncertain\nparameters only become observable after an often costly investment. To fill\nthis gap, we consider two- and multi-stage robust optimization problems in\nwhich part of the decision variables control the time of information discovery.\nThus, information available at any given time is decision-dependent and can be\ndiscovered (at least in part) by making strategic exploratory investments in\nprevious stages. We propose a novel dynamic formulation of the problem and\nprove its correctness. We leverage our model to provide a solution method\ninspired from the K-adaptability approximation, whereby K candidate strategies\nfor each decision stage are chosen here-and-now and, at the beginning of each\nperiod, the best of these strategies is selected after the uncertain parameters\nthat were chosen to be observed are revealed. We reformulate the problem as a\nfinite program solvable with off-the-shelf solvers. We generalize our approach\nto the minimization of piecewise linear convex functions. We demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our method on synthetic instances of the Pandora box problem,\nthe best box problem, and the R&D project portfolio optimization problem.\nFinally, we evaluate it on an instance of the active preference elicitation\nproblem used to recommend kidney allocation policies to policy-makers at the\nUnited Network for Organ Sharing based on real data from the U.S. Kidney\nAllocation System.\n"}

{"text": "Photopolarimetric Monitoring of Blazars in the Optical and Near-Infrared\n  Bands with the Kanata Telescope. I. Correlations between Flux, Color, and\n  Polarization   We report on the correlation between the flux, color and polarization\nvariations on time scales of days--months in blazars, and discuss their\nuniversal aspects. We performed monitoring of 42 blazars in the optical and\nnear-infrared bands from 2008 to 2010 using TRISPEC attached to the \"Kanata\"\n1.5-m telescope. We found that 28 blazars exhibited \"bluer-when-brighter\"\ntrends in their whole or a part of time-series data sets. This corresponds to\n88% of objects that were observed for >10 days. Thus, our observation\nunambiguously confirmed that the \"bluer-when-brighter\" trend is common in the\nemission from blazar jets. This trend was apparently generated by a variation\ncomponent with a constant and relatively blue color and an underlying red\ncomponent. Prominent short-term flares on time scales of days--weeks tended to\nexhibit a spectral hysteresis; their rising phases were bluer than their decay\nphases around the flare maxima. In contrast to the strong flux--color\ncorrelation, the correlation of the flux and polarization degree was relatively\nweak; only 10 objects showed significant positive correlations. Rotations of\npolarization were detected only in three objects: PKS 1510-089, 3C 454.3, and\nPKS 1749+096, and possibly in S5 0716+714. We also investigated the dependence\nof the degree of variability on the luminosity and the synchrotron peak\nfrequency, \\nu_peak. As a result, we found that lower luminosity and higher\n\\nu_peak objects had smaller variations in their amplitudes both in the flux,\ncolor, and polarization degree. Our observation suggests the presence of\nseveral distinct emitting sources, which have different variation time-scales,\ncolors, and polarizations. We propose that the energy injection by, for\nexample, internal shocks in relativistic shells is a major factor for blazar\nvariations on time scales of both days and months.\n"}

Methods: The SPARCQ framework uses phase-cycled bSSFP\nacquisitions to obtain bSSFP signal profiles. For each voxel, the profile is\ndecomposed into a weighted sum of simulated profiles with specific\noff-resonance and relaxation time ratios. From the obtained set of weights,\nvoxel-wise estimations of the fractions of the different components and their\nequilibrium magnetization are extracted. For the entire image volume,\ncomponent-specific quantitative maps as well as banding-artifact-free images\nare generated. A SPARCQ proof-of-concept was provided for water-fat separation\nand fat fraction mapping. Noise robustness was assessed using simulations. A\ndedicated water-fat phantom was used to validate fat fractions estimated with\nSPARCQ against gold-standard 1H MRS. Quantitative maps were obtained in knees\nof six healthy volunteers, and SPARCQ repeatability was evaluated in scan\nrescan experiments. Results: Simulations showed that fat fraction estimations\nare accurate and robust for signal-to-noise ratios above 20.

In particular, we\ninvestigate the possibility of treating the full control task in terms of\nindependent two-level Landau-Zener problems. We first show that the time\nprofiles of the elements of the full control Hamiltonian are characterized by\npeaks centered around the crossing times. These peaks decay algebraically for\nlarge times. In principle, such a power-law scaling invalidates the hypothesis\nof perfect separability.

{"text": "Primordial Black Holes from Inflation with Nonminimal Derivative\n  Coupling   We propose a novel enhancement mechanism of the curvature perturbations in\nthe nonminimal derivative coupling inflation model with a coupling parameter\nrelated to the inflaton field. By considering a special form of the coupling\nparameter as a function of the inflaton, a period of ultra-slow-roll inflation\ncan be realized due to the gravitationally enhanced friction, and the resulting\npower spectrum of the curvature perturbations has a sharp peak, which is large\nenough to produce the primordial black holes. Under this mechanism, we can\neasily obtain a sharp mass spectrum of primordial black holes around specific\nmasses such as $\\mathcal{O}(10)M_\\odot$, $\\mathcal{O}(10^{-5})M_\\odot$, and\n$\\mathcal{O}(10^{-12})M_\\odot$, which can explain the LIGO events, the\nultrashort-timescale microlensing events in OGLE data, and the most of dark\nmatter, respectively.\n"}

{"text": "Sparse Representation of Photometric Redshift PDFs: Preparing for\n  Petascale Astronomy   One of the consequences of entering the era of precision cosmology is the\nwidespread adoption of photometric redshift probability density functions\n(PDFs). Both current and future photometric surveys are expected to obtain\nimages of billions of distinct galaxies. As a result, storing and analyzing all\nof these PDFs will be non-trivial and even more severe if a survey plans to\ncompute and store multiple different PDFs. In this paper we propose the use of\na sparse basis representation to fully represent individual photo-$z$ PDFs. By\nusing an Orthogonal Matching Pursuit algorithm and a combination of Gaussian\nand Voigt basis functions, we demonstrate how our approach is superior to a\nmulti-Gaussian fitting, as we require approximately half of the parameters for\nthe same fitting accuracy with the additional advantage that an entire PDF can\nbe stored by using a 4-byte integer per basis function, and we can achieve\nbetter accuracy by increasing the number of bases. By using data from the\nCFHTLenS, we demonstrate that only ten to twenty points per galaxy are\nsufficient to reconstruct both the individual PDFs and the ensemble redshift\ndistribution, $N(z)$, to an accuracy of 99.9% when compared to the one built\nusing the original PDFs computed with a resolution of $\\delta z = 0.01$,\nreducing the required storage of two hundred original values by a factor of ten\nto twenty. Finally, we demonstrate how this basis representation can be\ndirectly extended to a cosmological analysis, thereby increasing computational\nperformance without losing resolution nor accuracy.\n"}

{"text": "On bayesian estimation and proximity operators   There are two major routes to address the ubiquitous family of inverse\nproblems appearing in signal and image processing, such as denoising or\ndeblurring. A first route relies on Bayesian modeling, where prior\nprobabilities are used to embody models of both the distribution of the unknown\nvariables and their statistical dependence with the observed data. The\nestimation process typically relies on the minimization of an expected loss\n(e.g. minimum mean squared error, or MMSE). The second route has received much\nattention in the context of sparse regularization and compressive sensing: it\nconsists in designing (often convex) optimization problems involving the sum of\na data fidelity term and a penalty term promoting certain types of unknowns\n(e.g., sparsity, promoted through an 1 norm). Well known relations between\nthese two approaches have lead to some widely spread misconceptions. In\nparticular, while the so-called Maximum A Posterori (MAP) estimate with a\nGaussian noise model does lead to an optimization problem with a quadratic\ndata-fidelity term, we disprove through explicit examples the common belief\nthat the converse would be true. It has already been shown [7, 9] that for\ndenoising in the presence of additive Gaussian noise, for any prior probability\non the unknowns, MMSE estimation can be expressed as a penalized least squares\nproblem, with the apparent characteristics of a MAP estimation problem with\nGaussian noise and a (generally) different prior on the unknowns. In other\nwords, the variational approach is rich enough to build all possible MMSE\nestimators associated to additive Gaussian noise via a well chosen penalty. We\ngeneralize these results beyond Gaussian denoising and characterize noise\nmodels for which the same phenomenon occurs. In particular, we prove that with\n(a variant of) Poisson noise and any prior probability on the unknowns, MMSE\nestimation can again be expressed as the solution of a penalized least squares\noptimization problem. For additive scalar denois-ing the phenomenon holds if\nand only if the noise distribution is log-concave. In particular, Laplacian\ndenoising can (perhaps surprisingly) be expressed as the solution of a\npenalized least squares problem. In the multivariate case, the same phenomenon\noccurs when the noise model belongs to a particular subset of the exponential\nfamily. For multivariate additive denoising, the phenomenon holds if and only\nif the noise is white and Gaussian.\n"}

However, when these\ndistributions are unknown, the Kalman filter is not necessarily optimal and\nother simpler state-estimators, such as fixed-gain ({\\alpha}, {\\alpha}-\\b{eta}\nor {\\alpha}-\\b{eta}-{\\gamma} etc.) filters may be sufficient. When such filters\nare used as low-complexity state-estimators in embedded tracking systems, the\nfixed gain parameters are usually set equal to the steady-state gains of the\ncorresponding Kalman filter. An alternative procedure, that does not rely prior\ndistributions, based on Luenberger observers, is presented here. It is\nsuggested that the arbitrary placement of closed-loop state-observer poles is a\nsimple and intuitive way of tuning the transient and steady-state response of a\nfixed-gain tracking filter when prior distributions are unknown. All poles are\nplaced inside the unit circle on the positive real axis of the complex z-plane\nat p for a well damped response and a configurable bandwidth. Transient bias\nerrors, e.g. due to target manoeuvres or process modelling errors, decrease as\np=0 is approached for a wider bandwidth.

{"text": "Classification of Electromagnetic and Gravitational Hopfions by\n  Algebraic Type   We extend the definition of hopfions to include a class of spin-$h$ fields\nand use this to introduce the electromagnetic and gravitational hopfions of\ndifferent algebraic types. The fields are constructed through the Penrose\ncontour integral transform, thus the singularities of the generating functions\nare directly related to the geometry of the resulting physical fields. We\ndiscuss this relationship and how the topological structure of the fields is\nrelated to the Robinson congruence. Since the topology appears in the lines of\nforce for both electromagnetism and gravity, the gravito-electromagnetic\nformalism is used to analyze the gravitational hopfions and describe the time\nevolution of their tendex and vortex lines. The correspondence between fields\nof different spin results in analogous configurations based on the same\ntopological structure. The null and type N fields propagate at the speed of\nlight, while the non-null and type D fields radiate energy outward from the\ncenter. Finally we discuss the type III gravitational hopfion, which has no\ndirect electromagnetic analog, but find that it still exhibits some of the\ncharacteristic features common to the other hopfion fields.\n"}

{"text": "Emergence of Hierarchy on a Network of Complementary Agents   Complementarity is one of the main features underlying the interactions in\nbiological and biochemical systems. Inspired by those systems we propose a\nmodel for the dynamical evolution of a system composed by agents that interact\ndue to their complementary attributes rather than their similarities. Each\nagent is represented by a bit-string and has an activity associated to it; the\ncoupling among complementary peers depends on their activity. The connectivity\nof the system changes in time respecting the constraint of complementarity. We\nobserve the formation of a network of active agents whose stability depends on\nthe rate at which activity diffuses in the system. The model exhibits a\nnon-equilibrium phase transition between the ordered phase, where a stable\nnetwork is generated, and a disordered phase characterized by the absence of\ncorrelation among the agents. The ordered phase exhibits multi-modal\ndistributions of connectivity and activity, indicating a hierarchy of\ninteraction among different populations characterized by different degrees of\nactivity. This model may be used to study the hierarchy observed in social\norganizations as well as in business and other networks.\n"}

In order to\nvalidate our theoretical findings, we present a classical block structured\nproblem stemming from a FEM approximation of a second order differential\nproblem. We focus on two multigrid strategies that use the geometric and the\nstandard bisection grid transfer operators and we prove that both fall into the\ncategory of projectors satisfying the proposed conditions. In addition, using a\ntensor product argument, we provide a strategy to construct efficient V-cycle\nprocedures in the block multilevel setting.\n"}

{"text": "Induced transparency by coupling of Tamm and defect states in tunable\n  terahertz plasmonic crystals   Photonic crystals and metamaterials have emerged as two classes of tailorable\nmaterials that enable precise control of light. Plasmonic crystals, which can\nbe thought of as photonic crystals fabricated from plasmonic materials, Bragg\nscatter incident electromagnetic waves from a repeated unit cell.

{"text": "Impact of Size-dependent Grain Temperature on Gas-Grain Chemistry in\n  Protoplanetary Disks: the case of low mass star disks   Grain surface chemistry is key to the composition of protoplanetary disks\naround young stars. The temperature of grains depends on their size. We\nevaluate the impact of this temperature dependence on the disk chemistry. We\nmodel a moderately massive disk with 16 different grain sizes. We use POLARIS\nto calculate the dust grain temperatures and the local UV flux. We model the\nchemistry using the 3-phase astrochemical code NAUTILUS. Photoprocesses are\nhandled using frequency-dependent cross-sections, and a new method to account\nfor self and mutual shielding. The multi-grain model outputs are compared to\nthose of single-grain size models (0.1 $\\mu$m), with two different assumptions\nfor their equivalent temperature. We find that the Langmuir-Hinshelwood (LH)\nmechanism at equilibrium temperature is not efficient to form H$_2$ at 3-4\nscale heights ($H$), and adopt a parametric fit to a stochastic method to model\nH$_2$ formation instead. We find the molecular layer composition (1-3 $H$) to\ndepend on the amount of remaining H atoms. Differences in molecular surface\ndensities between single and multi-grain models are mostly due to what occurs\nabove 1.5 $H$. At 100 au, models with colder grains produce H$_2$O and CH$_4$\nices in the midplane, and warmer ones produce more CO$_2$ ices, both allowing\nefficient depletion of C and O as soon as CO sticks on grain surfaces. Complex\norganic molecules (COMs) production is enhanced by the presence of warmer\ngrains in the multi-grain models. Using a single grain model mimicking grain\ngrowth and dust settling fails to reproduce the complexity of gas-grain\nchemistry. Chemical models with a single grain size are sensitive to the\nadopted grain temperature, and cannot account for all expected effects. A\nspatial spread of the snowlines is expected to result from the ranges in grain\ntemperature. The amplitude of the effects will depend on the dust disk mass.\n"}

If the source of $CP$ violation resides entirely in the\nhadronic sector, the two-photon exchange processes between electrons and the\nnucleus induce $CP$-odd semileptonic interactions, parametrised by the Wilson\ncoefficient $C_{SP}$, and provide the dominant source of EDMs in paramagnetic\nsystems instead of $d_e$.

The trails consist predominantly of\ncometary particles with sizes of approximately 0.1 mm to 1 cm which are ejected\nat low speeds and remain very close to the comet orbit for several revolutions\naround the Sun. When re-analysing the Helios dust data measured in the 1970s,\nAltobelli et al.

We re-analyse these\ncandidate cometary trail particles to investigate the possibility that some or\nall of them indeed originate from cometary trails and we constrain their source\ncomets. The Interplanetary Meteoroid Environment for eXploration (IMEX) dust\nstreams in space model is a new universal model for cometary meteoroid streams\nin the inner solar system, developed by Soja et al.

{"text": "SpookyNet: Learning Force Fields with Electronic Degrees of Freedom and\n  Nonlocal Effects   Machine-learned force fields (ML-FFs) combine the accuracy of ab initio\nmethods with the efficiency of conventional force fields. However, current\nML-FFs typically ignore electronic degrees of freedom, such as the total charge\nor spin state, and assume chemical locality, which is problematic when\nmolecules have inconsistent electronic states, or when nonlocal effects play a\nsignificant role. This work introduces SpookyNet, a deep neural network for\nconstructing ML-FFs with explicit treatment of electronic degrees of freedom\nand quantum nonlocality. Chemically meaningful inductive biases and analytical\ncorrections built into the network architecture allow it to properly model\nphysical limits. SpookyNet improves upon the current state-of-the-art (or\nachieves similar performance) on popular quantum chemistry data sets. Notably,\nit is able to generalize across chemical and conformational space and can\nleverage the learned chemical insights, e.g. by predicting unknown spin states,\nthus helping to close a further important remaining gap for today's machine\nlearning models in quantum chemistry.\n"}

Many BUS segmentation approaches\nhave been studied in the last two decades, but the performances of most\napproaches have been assessed using relatively small private datasets with\ndifferent quantitative metrics, which results in a discrepancy in performance\ncomparison.

However, a fleet of EVs\nwith different EV battery charging rate constraints, that is distributed across\na smart power grid network requires a coordinated charging schedule to minimize\nthe power generation and EV charging costs. In this paper, we study a joint\noptimal power flow (OPF) and EV charging problem that augments the OPF problem\nwith charging EVs over time. While the OPF problem is generally nonconvex and\nnonsmooth, it is shown recently that the OPF problem can be solved optimally\nfor most practical power networks using its convex dual problem. Building on\nthis zero duality gap result, we study a nested optimization approach to\ndecompose the joint OPF and EV charging problem. We characterize the optimal\noffline EV charging schedule to be a valley-filling profile, which allows us to\ndevelop an optimal offline algorithm with computational complexity that is\nsignificantly lower than centralized interior point solvers. Furthermore, we\npropose a decentralized online algorithm that dynamically tracks the\nvalley-filling profile.

To quantify this behavior we\nuse the recently introduced notion of network harness.

{"text": "Testing time evolution of the mass distribution of the black hole\n  mergers   Detection of the gravitational-wave events revealed that there are numerous\npopulation of the black hole binaries which can merge within the age of the\nUniverse. Although several formation channels of such binaries are known,\nconsiderable theoretical uncertainties associated in each channel defeats the\nrobust prediction of how much each channel contributes to the total merger rate\ndensity. Given that the time evolution of the merger rate density in some\nchannels is (exactly or nearly) independent of the BH masses, clarifying this\nfeature from the observational data will shed some light on the nature of the\nblack hole binaries. Based on this motivation, we formulate the methodology to\nperform the statistical test of whether the mass distribution of the black hole\nmergers evolves in time or not by means of the hypothesis testing. Our\nstatistical test requires neither a priori specification of the mass\ndistribution which is largely uncertain nor that of the time dependence of the\nmerger rate. We then apply it to the mock data for some concrete shapes of the\nmerger rate density and show that the proposed method rejects/(does not reject)\nthe null hypothesis correctly for the large sample size.

This stochastic partial differential describes a remarkably wide range\nof physical systems: coupled non-linear oscillators subject to external noise\nnear a Hopf bifurcation instability; spontaneous structure formation in\nnon-equilibrium systems, e.g., in cyclically competing populations; and\ndriven-dissipative Bose--Einstein condensation, realized in open systems on the\ninterface of quantum optics and many-body physics, such as cold atomic gases\nand exciton-polaritons in pumped semiconductor quantum wells in optical\ncavities.

A direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) scheme\nof double ionization is proposed and incorporated into a 2D particle-in-cell\n(PIC) method.

Despite\nthis theoretical hardness, SAT solvers based on Conflict Driven Clause Learning\n(CDCL) can solve large SAT instances from many important domains. CDCL learns\nclauses from conflicts, a technique that allows a solver to prune its search\nspace. The selection heuristics in CDCL prioritize variables that are involved\nin recent conflicts. While only a fraction of decisions generate any conflicts,\nmany generate multiple conflicts.\n  In this paper, we study conflict-generating decisions in CDCL in detail. We\ninvestigate the impact of single conflict (sc) decisions, which generate only\none conflict, and multi-conflict (mc) decisions which generate two or more. We\nempirically characterize these two types of decisions based on the quality of\nthe learned clauses produced by each type of decision. We also show an\nimportant connection between consecutive clauses learned within the same mc\ndecision, where one learned clause triggers the learning of the next one\nforming a chain of clauses. This leads to the consideration of similarity\nbetween conflicts, for which we formulate the notion of conflictsproximity as a\nsimilarity measure. We show that conflicts in mc decisions are more closely\nrelated than consecutive conflicts generated from sc decisions. Finally, we\ndevelop Common Reason Variable Reduction (CRVR) as a new decision strategy that\nreduces the selection priority of some variables from the learned clauses of mc\ndecisions. Our empirical evaluation of CRVR implemented in three leading\nsolvers demonstrates performance gains in benchmarks from the main track of SAT\nCompetition-2020.\n"}
{"text": "Dilatometry study of the ferromagnetic order in single-crystalline URhGe   Thermal expansion measurements have been carried out on single-crystalline\nURhGe in the temperature range from 2 to 200 K.

This implies that the uniaxial pressure dependencies of the Curie\ntemperature, determined by the Ehrenfest relation, are all positive.\nConsequently, the calculated hydrostatic pressure dependence dT_C/dp is\npositive and amounts to 0.12 K/kbar. In addition, the effective Gruneisen\nparameter was determined.

{"text": "Resolving mixing in Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics   Standard formulations of smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) are unable to\nresolve mixing at fluid boundaries. We use an error and stability analysis of\nthe generalised SPH equations of motion to prove that this is due to two\ndistinct problems. The first is a leading order error in the momentum equation.\nThis should decrease with increasing neighbour number, but does not because\nnumerical instabilities cause the kernel to be irregularly sampled. We identify\ntwo important instabilities: the clumping instability and the banding\ninstability, and we show that both are cured by a suitable choice of kernel.\nThe second problem is the local mixing instability (LMI). This occurs as\nparticles attempt to mix on the kernel scale, but are unable to due to entropy\nconservation. The result is a pressure discontinuity at boundaries that pushes\nfluids of different entropy apart. We cure the LMI by using a weighted density\nestimate that ensures that pressures are single valued throughout the flow.\nThis also gives a better volume estimate for the particles, reducing errors in\nthe continuity and momentum equations.

Sahel and Eastern Australia are remarkably dry regions, where low\namounts of rainfall are uniformly distributed on continental scales and\nsmall-scale extreme events are rare. As a consequence, the precipitation\ngradient is low, making these regions well connected on a large spatial scale.\nOn the contrary, the Asiatic South-East is often reached by extreme events such\nas monsoons, tropical cyclones and heat waves, which can all contribute to\nreduce the correlation to the short-range scale only.\n  Some patterns emerging between mid-latitude and tropical regions suggest a\npossible impact of the propagation of planetary waves on precipitation at a\nglobal scale.

Evidence for a population of group II disks with\n  gaps   The disks around Herbig Ae/Be stars are commonly divided into group I and\ngroup II based on their far-infrared spectral energy distribution, and the\ncommon interpretation for that is flared and flat disks. Recent observations\nsuggest that many flaring disks have gaps, whereas flat disks are thought to be\ngapless. The different groups of objects can be expected to have different\nstructural signatures in high-angular-resolution data. Over the past 10 years,\nthe MIDI instrument on the Very Large Telescope Interferometer has collected\nobservations of several tens of protoplanetary disks. We model the large set of\nobservations with simple geometric models. A population of radiative-transfer\nmodels is synthesized for interpreting the mid-infrared signatures. Objects\nwith similar luminosities show very different disk sizes in the mid-infrared.\nRestricting to the young objects of intermediate mass, we confirm that most\ngroup I disks are in agreement with being transitional. We find that several\ngroup II objects have mid-infrared sizes and colors overlapping with sources\nclassified as group I, transition disks. This suggests that these sources have\ngaps, which has been demonstrated for a subset of them. This may point to an\nintermediate population between gapless and transition disks. Flat disks with\ngaps are most likely descendants of flat disks without gaps. Gaps, potentially\nrelated to the formation of massive bodies, may therefore even develop in disks\nin a far stage of grain growth and settling. The evolutionary implications of\nthis new population could be twofold. Either gapped flat disks form a separate\npopulation of evolved disks, or some of them may further evolve into flaring\ndisks with large gaps. The latter transformation may be governed by the\ninteraction with a massive planet, carving a large gap and dynamically exciting\nthe grain population in the disk.\n"}

{"text": "A Novel Image Encryption Scheme Based on Different Block Sizes for\n  Grayscale and Color Images   In this paper, two image encryption schemes are proposed for grayscale and\ncolor images. The two encryption schemes are based on dividing each image into\nblocks of different sizes. In the first scheme, the two dimension ($2$D) input\nimage is divided into various blocks of size $N \\times N$. Each block is\ntransformed into a one dimensional ($1$D) array by using the Zigzag pattern.\nThen, the exclusive or (XOR) logical operation is used to encrypt each block\nwith the analogous secret key. In the second scheme, after the transformation\nprocess, the first block of each image is encrypted by the corresponding secret\nkey. Then, before the next block is encrypted, it is XORed with the first\nencrypted block to become the next input to the encrypting routine and so on.\nThis feedback mechanism depends on the cipher block chaining (CBC) mode of\noperation which considers the heart of some ciphers because it is highly\nnonlinear. In the case of color images, the color component is separated into\nblocks with the same size and different secret keys. The used secret key\nsequences are generated from elliptic curves (EC) over a \\textit{binary} finite\nfield $\\mathbb{F}_{2^{m}}$. Finally, the experimental results are carried out\nand security analysis of the ciphered images are demonstrated that the two\nproposed schemes had a better performance in terms of security, sensitivity and\nrobustness.\n"}

On the contrary,\nfor the other two-axis twisting Hamiltonian\n$H_{\\text{TAT}}=q(J_{x}^{2}-J_{y}^{2})$, the maximal squeezing factor scales as\n$N^{-1}$, approaching the Heisenberg limit. In this paper, inspired by recent\nexperiments of cavity-assisted Raman transitions, we propose a scheme, in which\nan ensemble of ultracold six-level atoms interacts with two quantized cavity\nfields and two pairs of Raman lasers, to realize a tunable two-axis spin\nHamiltonian $%H=q(J_{x}^{2}+\\chi J_{y}^{2})+\\omega_{0}J_{z}$.

{"text": "Metal-insulator transition in the 2D Hubbard model: dual fermion\n  approach with the Lanczos exact diagonalization   In this study the metal-insulator transition in the square-lattice Hubbard\nmodel at half-filling is revisited in relation to the DOS and spectral\nfunctions by means of the ladder dual fermion approximation (LDFA). For this\npurpose, a new expression of the two-body Green's function in the form of\nresolvents is proposed, which provides tractable and efficient means to\ncalculate the local vertex function with the Lanczos exact diagonalization (ED)\nmethod. This makes it possible to use the Lanczos ED method as a solver of the\neffective impurity Anderson model for LDFA, opening up the way to access low\ntemperatures for these perturbative extensions of the dynamical mean field\ntheory and to obtain accurate DOS and spectral functions on the real frequency\naxis by a new variant of the maximum entropy method. It is found that for $U\\le\n3.5t$, as temperature decreases, the pseudogap formation due to\nantiferromagnetic correlations in the quasiparticle peak of the spectral\nfunction occurs at the X point $[k=(\\pi,0)]$, spreads through the Fermi surface\nand ends at the M$_2$ point $[k=(\\pi/2,\\pi/2)]$.

Although the pseudogap\nstill appears in the quasi-particle-like single peak for $U\\ge 4.0t$, the\nFermi-liquid feature is partially lost on the Fermi surface already at higher\ntemperatures as expected in the Mott-Heisenberg regime, in which local spins\nare preformed at high temperatures.

The\nvariety of optimal surfaces embedded in 3D is controlled by spatial dependence\nof the refraction coefficient which, in turn, is dictated by the local growth\nprotocol.\n"}
{"text": "Outer solar system possibly shaped by a stellar fly-by   The planets of our solar system formed from a gas-dust disk. However, there\nare some properties of the solar system that are peculiar in this context.\nFirst, the cumulative mass of all objects beyond Neptune (TNOs) is only a\nfraction of what one would expect. Second, unlike the planets themselves, the\nTNOs do not orbit on coplanar, circular orbits around the Sun, but move mostly\non inclined, eccentric orbits and are distributed in a complex way. This\nimplies that some process restructured the outer solar system after its\nformation. However, some of TNOs, referred to as Sednoids, move outside the\nzone of influence of the planets. Thus external forces must have played an\nimportant part in the restructuring of the outer solar system. The study\npresented here shows that a close fly-by of a neighbouring star can\nsimultaneously lead to the observed lower mass density outside 30 AU and excite\nthe TNOs onto eccentric, inclined orbits, including the family of Sednoids. In\nthe past it was estimated that such close fly-bys are rare during the relevant\ndevelopment stage. However, our numerical simulations show that such a scenario\nis much more likely than previously anticipated. A fly-by also naturally\nexplains the puzzling fact that Neptune has a higher mass than Uranus. Our\nsimulations suggest that many additional Sednoids at high inclinations still\nawait discovery, perhaps including bodies like the postulated planet X.\n"}
